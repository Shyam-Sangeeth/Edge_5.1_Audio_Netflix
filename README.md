# Netflix 5.1 Surround Sound for Edge

A Microsoft Edge browser extension that enables 5.1 surround sound audio playback on Netflix in both the Edge browser and Windows Netflix app.

## Overview

Netflix typically limits audio playback to stereo (2.0) on desktop browsers and the Windows app, even if you have a surround sound system. This extension bypasses that limitation, allowing you to enjoy Netflix content with full 5.1 channel surround sound in Microsoft Edge browser and the Windows Netflix application.

## Features

- Enables 5.1 surround sound audio on Netflix
- Works in both Microsoft Edge browser and Windows Netflix app
- Lightweight and easy to install
- No configuration required

## Requirements

- Microsoft Edge browser (Chromium-based) and/or Windows Netflix app
- Active Netflix subscription
- 5.1 surround sound capable audio system or headphones

3. Click **Get** to install the extension
4. The extension will install automatically and be ready to use

### Method 2: Install from source (Developer mode)

2. Play any video with 5.1 audio support
3. Verify 5.1 audio is active by checking your audio system or Netflix's audio settings during playback
